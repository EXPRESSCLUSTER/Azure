Even though the DCR is created using the DCE-DCR-Template.json template, the Data source is NOT created. This is because the table name is hard coded in the template to 'DHCPLogs' AND it doesn't have the _CL extension. I have created an updated version which uses the table name variable 'AzTableName'. It uses the code already existing to concatenate 'Custom-' to the beginning of the table name: "[concat('Custom-',parameters('AzTableName'))]". Then uses "[parameters('AzTableName')]" for the tablename. 

FYI: If the table name entered in the script doesn't have '_CL' on the end, the script automatically appends it to the name.
